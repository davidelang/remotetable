#!/bin/bash
#
# get-builds-tag.sh
#
# Safe, blessed helper for agents (Grok, Gemini, etc.) to obtain the current
# per-branch builds tag for preflight verification before any git reset --hard.
#
# This encapsulates the exact logic from AGENT_MANDATES.md so agents do not
# have to inline a long, variable-containing command that triggers repeated
# permission prompts.
#
# Usage:
#   TAG=$(./get-builds-tag.sh)
#   echo "Using tag: $TAG"
#   git rev-parse "$TAG"   # (helper already verified it exists)
#
# On success: prints the tag name (e.g. "feature-foo/builds" or "builds") to stdout.
# On failure (no such tag): prints error to stderr and exits 1.
#
# This script has no side effects and only performs read-only git operations.
# It is intended to be pre-approved in .grok/config.toml under the blessed
# scripts section so repeated invocations do not require per-use permission.
#
# Must be run from inside a git worktree (enforced).
